## Image Guidelines

- All images should be optimized for web (compressed, appropriate file size)
- Use descriptive alt text when adding images to HTML
- Maintain aspect ratios for consistent display
- Images will be displayed with overlay for readability

## Current Status

These images are referenced in the HTML but need to be added. The pages will display correctly with gradient overlays even if images are not present, but adding images will enhance the visual appeal.
